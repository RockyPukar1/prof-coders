# Data/Information
-> can be categorized/grouped

# Data Types
1) Primitive
    -4 -3 -2 -1 0 +1 +2 +3 +4
    a) Integer(numbers without points/decimals)
    -> -infinity ... 0 ... +infinity
    eg: 12, -7, 0, 
    b) Floating numbers(numbers with points/decimals)
    -> -infinity ... 0 ... +infinity
    eg: 3.1415, -0.043, 0.00
    c) Boolean: True, False
    -> I am dancing.
    -> Yes(True)/No(false) Question? -> Am I dancing?
        -> am_i_dancing = True
    -> He is here
        -> Is he here? -> True
        -> is_he_here = True
    -> This should not happen

        -> should_this_happen = False
    -> I am sorry

        -> am_i_sorry = True
    d) String(Anything wrapped between single quote ' or double quote " but not both)
    NOTE:
    - In other programming language char->'a', string-> "a"
    - Null, undefined
2) Non-primitive
    a) List/Collection
    index/position
    - start 0
    - ordered, mutable, can have duplicate
    [item1, item2, item3]
    b) Tuple
    - ordered, immutable, can have duplicate
    c) Set
    - unordered, immutable, no duplicate

    d) Dictionary/object
    -> key value pair
