1. Create a Class with instance attributes
class Vehicle:
  # Static Attribute/Property
  
  # Method
  # constructor
  def __init__(self, max_speed, mileage):
    # Instant attribute/property
    self.max_speed = max_speed
    self.mileage = mileage


car = Vehicle(500, 20)

print(car.max_speed)
print(car.mileage)

2. Create a Vehicle class without any variables and methods
class Vehicle:
  pass

3. Create a child class Bus that will inherit all of the variables and methods of the Vehicle class
class Vehicle:
  def __init__(self, name, max_speed, mileage):
    self.name = name
    self.max_speed = max_speed
    self.mileage = mileage
  

class Bus(Vehicle):
  def __init__(self, name, max_speed, mileage):
    super().__init__(name, max_speed, mileage)
  
  def __str__(self):
    return f"Vehicle name = {self.name}, max speed = {self.max_speed}, mileage = {self.mileage}"
    # return "Vehicle name = " + self.name + ", max speed = " + str(self.max_speed) + ", mileage = " + str(self.mileage)

eicher = Bus("Eicher - The Horseman", 230, 35)
honda = Bus("Honda - Vrum vrum", 500, 20)

print(eicher)
print(honda)


4. Class Inheritance
class Vehicle:
  def __init__(self, name, max_speed, mileage):
    self.name = name
    self.max_speed = max_speed
    self.mileage = mileage

  def seating_capacity(self, capacity):
    return f"The seating capacity of a {self.name} is {capacity} passengers"

class Bus(Vehicle):
  def __init__(self, name, max_speed, mileage):
    super().__init__(name, max_speed, mileage)

  # Override
  # Polymorphism
  def seating_capacity(self, capacity = 50):
    return f"The seating capacity of a {self.name} is {capacity} passengers"

eicher = Bus("Eicher - The Horseman", 230, 50)
print(eicher.seating_capacity())


5. Define a property that must have the same value for every class instance (object)
class Vehicle:
  color = "white"
  def __init__(self, name, max_speed, mileage):
    self.name = name
    self.max_speed = max_speed
    self.mileage = mileage

class Bus(Vehicle):
  pass

class Car(Vehicle):
  pass


School_bus = Bus("School Volvo", 180, 12)
print(School_bus.color, School_bus.name, "Speed:", School_bus.max_speed, "Mileage:", School_bus.mileage)

car = Car("Audi Q5", 240, 18)
print(car.color, car.name, "Speed:", car.max_speed, "Mileage:", car.mileage)

6.
class Vehicle:
  def __init__(self, name, mileage, capacity):
    self.name = name
    self.mileage = mileage
    self.capacity = capacity

  def fare(self):
    return self.capacity * 100

class Bus(Vehicle):
  def __init__(self, name, mileage, capacity):
    super().__init__(name, mileage, capacity)

  def fare(self):
    total_fare = self.capacity * 100
    return total_fare + (10 / 100) * total_fare

School_bus = Bus("School Volvo", 12, 50)
print("Total Bus fare is:", School_bus.fare())

7.
use type()

*: Program to name file as untitled-{number}
class FileName:
  count = 0
  def __init__(self, file_name = None):
    if file_name is None:
      FileName.count = FileName.count + 1
      self.file_name = f"Untitled-{FileName.count}"
    else:
      self.file_name = file_name
  
  @staticmethod
  def delete_file():
    FileName.count = FileName.count - 1

oop = FileName()
python = FileName("main.py")
java = FileName()
FileName.delete_file()
c = FileName()
print(oop.file_name)
print(python.file_name)
print(java.file_name)
print(c.file_name)
