1. Create a Class with instance attributes
class Vehicle:
  # Static Attribute/Property
  
  # Method
  # constructor
  def __init__(self, max_speed, mileage):
    # Instant attribute/property
    self.max_speed = max_speed
    self.mileage = mileage


car = Vehicle(500, 20)

print(car.max_speed)
print(car.mileage)

2. Create a Vehicle class without any variables and methods
class Vehicle:
  pass

3. Create a child class Bus that will inherit all of the variables and methods of the Vehicle class
class Vehicle:
  def __init__(self, name, max_speed, mileage):
    self.name = name
    self.max_speed = max_speed
    self.mileage = mileage
  

class Bus(Vehicle):
  def __init__(self, name, max_speed, mileage):
    super().__init__(name, max_speed, mileage)
  
  def __str__(self):
    return f"Vehicle name = {self.name}, max speed = {self.max_speed}, mileage = {self.mileage}"
    # return "Vehicle name = " + self.name + ", max speed = " + str(self.max_speed) + ", mileage = " + str(self.mileage)

eicher = Bus("Eicher - The Horseman", 230, 35)
honda = Bus("Honda - Vrum vrum", 500, 20)

print(eicher)
print(honda)

*: Program to name file as untitled-{number}
class FileName:
  count = 0
  def __init__(self, file_name = None):
    if file_name is None:
      FileName.count = FileName.count + 1
      self.file_name = f"Untitled-{FileName.count}"
    else:
      self.file_name = file_name
  
  @staticmethod
  def delete_file():
    FileName.count = FileName.count - 1

oop = FileName()
python = FileName("main.py")
java = FileName()
FileName.delete_file()
c = FileName()
print(oop.file_name)
print(python.file_name)
print(java.file_name)
print(c.file_name)
